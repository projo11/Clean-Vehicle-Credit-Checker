## About
Clean Vehicle Credit Checker is a proof-of-concept for a desktop application which lets you search for vehicles that qualify for tax credits. In its current state, it is able to sort though some sample data based on a user query. Eventually, the idea is that all of the data would pull from `.csv` files. The data would come from the official IRS publications found here:
