# Clean-Vehicle-Credit-Checker
Check if a vehicle qualifies for federal tax credits.
## Description
Clean Vehicle Credit Checker is a proof-of-concept for a desktop application which lets you search for vehicles that qualify for tax credits. In its current state, it is able to sort though some sample data based on a user query. Eventually, the idea is that all of the data would pull from `.csv` files. The data would come from the official IRS publications found here:

- [clean-vehicle-credit-30d-4-17-2023-and-before.pdf](clean-vehicle-credit-30d-4-17-2023-and-before.pdf)

## About
This was my first project using the Win32 API in C++. It's rather primative, but I am nonetheless proud of what I was able to accomplish. This project taught me a lot about how Win32 api generates windows and passes data between frames, and even if I never directly use it again, this information will be valuable to understanding what is going on under-the-hood of popular frameworks like .NET.
